        <div class="content">
            Thank you for using "SuperMemo" (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). We deeply value user privacy and implement strict technical measures to protect your personal information. This Privacy Policy aims to clearly and transparently explain how we handle your data. Please read it carefully before using the App.
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">1. Data Storage Principles</div>
            <div class="content">
                The App is a fully offline note and to-do management tool that adheres to the following core principles:
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                1. <strong>Local and iCloud Storage:</strong> All notes, to-do items, and related data you create (hereinafter collectively referred to as "App Data") are <strong>stored solely locally on your device</strong> and in your <strong>iCloud account</strong> associated with your personal Apple ID. We do not upload this data to any third-party servers operated or controlled by us.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                2. <strong>No Backend Services:</strong> The App <strong>has no backend servers</strong>. This means we are <strong>unable to collect, store, process, or access</strong> any of your App Data. Data synchronization occurs entirely between your devices via Apple's iCloud service.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                3. <strong>Data Ownership:</strong> You fully own and control all your App Data. You can add, delete, modify, query, and manage the synchronization of your data through the App's functions or directly via Apple's iCloud settings.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">2. Information We Collect</div>
            <div class="content">
                For the basic operation and functionality of the App, we only access information under the following necessary circumstances, through standard methods provided by Apple's operating system (iOS/iPadOS):
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                1. <strong>iCloud Read/Write Permissions:</strong> When you enable iCloud sync, the App requests access from the system to the storage space allocated for it within your iCloud Drive to read and write your App Data. This process is entirely managed by the Apple system; we cannot access other data in your iCloud.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                2. <strong>Anonymous Diagnostic Data (Optional):</strong> Depending on your system settings, Apple may provide us with <strong>completely anonymous, non-personally identifiable</strong> aggregated data through its "App Analytics" function, such as crash reports, performance metrics, and feature usage frequency (e.g., counts of "notes created," without specific content). You can choose whether to share this data with the App Developer in iOS/iPadOS under "Settings" > "Privacy & Security" > "Analytics & Improvements."
            </div>
            <div class="highlight">
                <strong>Our Commitment:</strong> We <strong>do not</strong> collect your identity information (such as name, email, Apple ID), device unique identifiers, location information, nor <strong>do we</strong> collect the specific content of your App Data.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <div class="section-title">3. Data Security</div>
            <div class="content">
                1. <strong>Transmission Security:</strong> When your App Data is synchronized across devices via iCloud, its encrypted transmission is <strong>solely the responsibility and handled by Apple Inc.</strong>, adhering to its globally leading security standards.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                2. <strong>Storage Security:</strong> Data stored locally on your device is protected by your device passcode, biometric locks, etc. Storage security within iCloud is ensured by Apple's encryption measures.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                3. <strong>Our Measures:</strong> Since we do not operate any servers and do not transmit your data to us, the risk of data interception or leakage at our end is fundamentally avoided.

            <div class="section-title">4. Third-Party Services</div>
            <div class="content">
                The App's core synchronization functionality relies on the <strong>Apple iCloud service</strong>. Your use, storage, and security of iCloud data are also governed by <strong>Apple's iCloud Terms and Conditions and its Privacy Policy</strong>. We recommend reviewing Apple's relevant policies to understand their data handling practices.
            </div>

                Apart from Apple iCloud, the App does not integrate any other third-party analytics, advertising, or social SDKs.
