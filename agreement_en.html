            Welcome to "Supernote" (hereinafter referred to as "the App" or "we"). This App is a tool focused on note-taking and task management. Before using the App, please read and understand the full content of this End User License Agreement (hereinafter referred to as "this Agreement"). <strong>Once you download, install, or use the App, you are deemed to have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by all terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree with any content of this Agreement, please stop using the App immediately.</strong>

            <div class="section-title">1. Service Description</div>
            <div class="content">
                1.1 The App provides functions for creating, editing, managing, synchronizing, and storing notes and to-do items. Data storage employs a combination of local storage and synchronization via Apple iCloud.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                1.2 <strong>The App does not require registration or login to a separate account.</strong> All operations are performed locally on your device. The iCloud synchronization function is automatically enabled based on the Apple ID you are logged into in your iOS/iPadOS system settings. This is a system-level service integration provided by Apple.

            <div class="content">
                2.1 When using the App, you should ensure that you fully understand the operating system functions of your device (iPhone/iPad), especially the settings and management of the iCloud service.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                2.2 You shall ensure that your use of the App complies with the laws and regulations of your country/region and does not infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of any third party.
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                2.3 If you wish to enable cross-device data synchronization, you need to log in with your Apple ID and enable the iCloud Drive service in your device's system settings. This process is entirely managed by the Apple system and is unrelated to this App.

            <div class="content">
                <strong>3.1 Dependence and Limitations of Data Storage:</strong> The App's data storage is highly dependent on:
                <div class="list-item">(a) The normal operation and local storage security of your device; and</div>
                <div class="list-item">(b) The status of the Apple ID account logged into your device's system and the stability and availability of the Apple iCloud service.</div>

                <strong>3.2 Data Loss Risk:</strong> Although we strive to ensure the stability of the App's local operation, the following situations (including but not limited to) may cause your data to be <strong>partially or completely lost, corrupted, out of sync, or inaccessible</strong>, and the associated risks are <strong>entirely borne by you</strong>:
                <div class="list-item">• Loss, damage, system reset, factory reset, or system upgrade of your device;</div>

                <div class="list-item">• You logging out of your Apple ID, turning off iCloud Drive service, or specifically disabling the App's iCloud sync permission in system settings;</div>
                <div class="list-item">• Interruption, malfunction, data rollback, insufficient storage space, policy change, or termination of the Apple iCloud service;</div>

                <strong>3.3 Mandatory Backup Obligation:</strong> In light of the above risks, <strong>you explicitly acknowledge and agree</strong> that the App is <strong>not</strong> a permanent, absolutely reliable data storage service. For any note or to-do data that you deem <strong>important, valuable, or irreplaceable</strong>, <strong>you must take regular and reliable independent backup measures.</strong> We strongly recommend that you back up important data to <strong>other independent storage media or cloud services</strong> by taking screenshots, manually copying to other apps, or using any export function the App may provide.

The developer shall not be held liable for any data problems arising from the use or inability to use the App, or any of the reasons mentioned in Clause 3.2 of this Agreement, or for any direct or indirect losses resulting therefrom.</strong> You understand and confirm that <strong>all risks associated with using the App are borne by you.</strong>

                5.2 <strong>Regarding Refunds:</strong> All transactions, billing, subscription management, and refund requests for in-app purchases must be processed through official Apple channels. As the developer cannot access, control, or interfere with Apple's transaction and payment systems, <strong>once a purchase is completed, the developer cannot directly process a refund for you.</strong> If you have questions about a purchase or need to request a refund, please contact Apple Support directly or visit the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204084" target="_blank">Apple Official Refund Support Page</a> to understand the procedures and policies.
